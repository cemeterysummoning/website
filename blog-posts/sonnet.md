I breathed my last goodbye on your table

Ravenous carnivores jumping to dig—

—into my flesh, slaughtered by your people

Feeling the hungry grins, their stomachs big.

<br/>

On display, face down, for all to marvel

Last year, I was with you, what a thrill—

—it was, an egg unhatched, the world a pearl

You vowed not to eat me then — do you still?

<br/>

And the toast is in progress, you’re speaking

On the altar, a slaughter to the lamb

And my cold, crucified, heart is beating

I am, I am, I am, I am, I am.

<br/>

And the serving knife sinks into my skin

Let the feast begin.
