I wrote this for a friend a while ago (Dec 23, 2022, to be exact). I think we were going through some things at the time. 
I deleted this from my page at some point, but I wanted to put it back. I found this poem again in my github commit history, and I just copy-pasted it back into this markdown file without deleting the duplicate content. But, I kind of like it this way. There's something poetic in letting glitches through.
